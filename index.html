<p>The investment banking industry is known for many things—generous pay, custom suits, relentless hours, forsaken social lives—but leading-edge technology? Not so much. While technology has transformed the very fabric of business and society, investment banking has remained remarkably unchanged. A day in the life of an investment banker in 2015 is shockingly similar to a day in, say, 2001. In fact, we can look as far back as the 1980s and identify only a couple technological breakthroughs that have fundamentally changed the way investment bankers work.:</p>

<p>In the ‘80s, as PCs began appearing on desks, spreadsheets were the “killer app” for business. Investment bankers quickly became Excel power users, analyzing data, building financial models, and charting numbers like never before. Financial data providers soon offered tools for downloading reasonably current data directly into spreadsheets. Armed with this capability, and using every Excel keyboard shortcut known to humankind, analysts and associates started cranking out increasingly intricate models and charts literally around the clock.</p>
<p>On the heels of this phenomenon came PowerPoint, which meant goodbye typing pools; hello pres-tech. Bankers, together with presentation support staff, could now produce a fully digital client deliverable. For years, investment bankers wowed their clients with pitchbooks containing information and charts the clients couldn’t get anywhere else.</p>

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Productivity on the road</h3>

<p>The next breakthrough came in 1999 with the introduction of the BlackBerry. Two-way pagers and personal digital assistants (PDAs) were harbingers of change, but it was the BlackBerry, with its mobile email, that really disrupted the status quo</p>
<p>Investment banks selectively doled out BlackBerrys, starting with senior bankers, giving them the extraordinary ability to stay connected while on the road. Soon, the devices trickled down to junior bankers where they became double-edged swords: productivity tools and “electronic leashes” that made it easy for senior bankers to track them down 24/7.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, BlackBerrys spread like wildfire in investment banks, accelerating the pace of work and adding a notoriously addictive element to an already all-consuming job. Over the next decade, banks began to support the growing number and variety of smartphones and tablets. In this time, mobile devices made immediate responsiveness the new standard.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Everything changed except the technology</h3>

<p>In late 2007, the financial crisis turned the world upside-down. Investment banks were among the institutions that were shaken to the core. Economic recession led to harsher regulation, declining revenue, increasing cost, and PR nightmares. Overnight, it became drastically harder to attract and retain top talent to once-prestigious firms, causing both cost and quality problems.</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, client demands only intensified. Clients gained access to more and more financial information and developed increasingly sophisticated analytical capabilities, making it harder for investment bankers to show them information they couldn’t get themselves. And, like everyone else, clients have become conditioned to expect that technology will make all business better. Given the impact technology has had on seemingly every aspect of business and life, surely it’s transformed investment banking as well, no?
</p>

<p>Actually, no. In every practical sense, the way investment bankers service their clients today is the same as it was 10 or 15 years ago. A handful of new tools have been added to the mix, such as Microsoft Office plug-ins and mobile document annotation, but the fundamental process hasn’t changed. Why? For a number years, there was no pressing need to change. Then, once the need arose, the solutions were less than earthshaking. To be fair, it’s a tough nut to crack.</p>
